                    <h2>Borderless Reimagined: teamLab's Digital Dreamscape Returns to Tokyo</h2>  
                    
                    <p>
                        There's a reason millions of visitors are obsessed with teamLab's art exhibitions: Where else can you spend an otherwise normal afternoon gazing into an infinity of crystal stars, chasing digital crows from room to room, or making flowers grow with the touch of a single, godlike finger? </p>   
                    <p>
                    TeamLab, an international collective of mathematicians, engineers and artists emerged in 2001, gaining traction with an early staging by the artist Takashi Murakami. Since then, the group, whose works aim to "navigate the confluence of art, science, technology and the natural world," has expanded globally, with permanent and temporary exhibitions in Asia, Europe and the United States. Last year, teamLab Planets, in Tokyo, welcomed 2.5 million people, setting a Guinness record as the most visited museum by a single art group. </p>   
                    <p>
                        TeamLab currently has 12 exhibitions in Japan, as well as sites in places like Singapore, Abu Dhabi, Macau, Miami, New York, and Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Installations or museums are planned for Hamburg, Germany; Utrecht, the Netherlands; Kyoto, Japan; and more.

                        These sensory playgrounds couldn't be farther from a sterile white art gallery. You may find yourself wading through a pool (yes, actual water) with digital koi fish or playing with streaming whirlpools of pixels. Sometimes the installations are set outdoors in dark rice paddies, as in Izura, Japan, or use strings of live orchids that rise and drop depending on your path, as at the Planets museum. In "Sketch" installations at several sites you use crayons to color in a creature, which then comes alive as a projection on the walls and the floor.

                    </p>   
                    <p>
                        The colors, textures and lighting are ripe for Instagramming, leading some critics to dismiss the installations as art candy or a tourist trap. But they also explore bigger themes of self, boundaries, interconnection, and life and death in the natural world. They lead you on a psychedelic journey without taking actual psychedelics.

                        Be ready to take off your shoes and get wet at teamLab Planets (admission 3,800 to 5,400 yen, or $26 to $37), which opened new rooms in January. This linear interactive space, in the city's Toyosu district, features elements like trampolines, mirrors, water and garden rooms. Inside, you can peer into a crystal starscape, wander through an immersive flower garden and wade with fluorescent koi. The new "Catching and Collecting Extinct Forest" installation allows you to catch and release digital endangered animals while learning about them on an integrated app. In the "Sketch" space, you can color your own creatures to be projected into the exhibit, and then in the Factory, buy a T-shirt with your creature on it. Even Emptiness Table, the museum's vegan ramen restaurant, offers an ever-changing digital art experience. </p>

                        Borderless, teamLab's other major Tokyo museum, in the Azabudai Hills district, is a nonlinear series of rooms to explore with no map and no directions. Clustered around a central waterfall, the rooms splinter off, with themes and motifs like bubbles and digital crows that fly from one installation to another. Take as long as you want to feel your way through. At the attached teahouse, enjoy the infinitely blooming flowers projected into your cup.
